## **About me**
 
I am the **Deputy Director Financial Regulation and Supervision** with <a href="https://digitalfrontiers.org" target="_bank">Digital Frontiers</a>. I obtained my MCom in Economics from the University of Pretoria in 2016. I previously worked for <a href="https://cenfri.org" target="_bank">Cenfri</a> as a **Senior Researcher** within the Risk, Remittances and Integrity Program and the <a href="https://www.centralbank.org.sz" target="_bank">The Central Bank of eSwatini</a> as a **Macroprudential Analyst** from which I moved on to **Manage** the CBE Intelligence Hub, which managed the activities of the newly established **Fintech Unit**.

I have a great passion for capacity building, which I firmly believe contributes to agile and innovative financial systems that are maintain their monetary and financial stability. My research interests include financial regulation, financial and gender inclusion, innovation in payment systems and digital currencies, such as CBDCs.
