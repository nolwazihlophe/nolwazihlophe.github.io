## About me
 
I am the **Senior Specialist** within the Fintech Department of the <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/Pages/Default.aspx" target="_bank">FSCA South Africa</a> and I have been recognized by <a href="https://africanshapers.com/en/60-african-women-experts-in-fintech/" target="_bank">African Shapers</a> as one of the Top 60 African Women who are Fintech Experts. I obtained my MCom in Economics from the University of Pretoria in 2016. I previously worked for <a href="https://digitalfrontiers.org" target="_bank">Digital Frontiers</a> as the **Deputy Director Financial Regulation and Supervision**, and <a href="https://cenfri.org" target="_bank">Cenfri</a> as a **Senior Researcher** within the Risk, Remittances and Integrity Program. Before that, I was with <a href="https://www.centralbank.org.sz" target="_bank">The Central Bank of eSwatini</a> as a **Macroprudential Analyst** from which I moved on to **Manage** the **CBE Intelligence Hub**, which managed the **Fintech Unit**, that was established in 2018. 

Throughout my years of experience, I developed and sharpened my knowledge and skills in anti-money laundering compliance, digital identity, cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation and its application, data privacy and protection legislation and its application, data management, relationship management, leadership and technical proposal writing towards fundraising. Additionally, I have experience and understanding of instant and inclusive payment systems and national payment systems, central bank digital currencies, proportional macroprudential and microprudential supervision as well as the use of financial regulatory tools towards increased gender, digital and financial inclusion.
