## About me
 
I have over eight years of experience in financial regulation and supervision, and I currently work as a Senior Fintech Specialist at <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/Pages/Default.aspx" target="_blank">FSCA</a> South Africa, the market conduct regulator of the financial services sector in South Africa. My role involves monitoring and analyzing emerging products, business models, and technologies in the industry. I lead research on artificial intelligence, open finance and decentralised finance. I am a member of the <a href="https://www.iaisweb.org/activities-topics/digital-innovation/" target="_blank">IAIS Fintech Forum</a> and <a href="https://www.thegfin.com/GFIN" target="_blank">GFIN</a>.

My passion is to advance financial inclusion, innovation, and stability in the region, and I have contributed to several research and policy initiatives in this field. For instance, I was the first Project Manager of the CBE Intelligence Hub at the <a href="https://www.centralbank.org.sz/" target="_blank">Central Bank of Eswatini</a>, where I defined the strategy and guidelines for the Fintech Unit and the Regulatory Sandbox in 2018. I have also been named among the 60 African Women Experts in Fintech by <a href="https://africanshapers.com/en/60-african-women-experts-in-fintech/" target="_blank">Africa Shapers</a> 2022. In addition, I have developed and sharpened my skills in anti-money laundering compliance, digital identity, cybersecurity, data privacy and protection, data management, relationship management, leadership, and technical proposal writing. I am also a Class Teacher for several online Economics courses at <a href="https://2u.com/" target="_blank">2U</a>, where I plan and host bi-weekly teaching calls and engage with students on the online campus.
